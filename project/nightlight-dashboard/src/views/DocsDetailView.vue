          <h2 id="sec-1-1">1.1 The Data Gap</h2>
          <p>
            Backup generators are everywhere — in hospital basements, airport terminals, fire stations,
            cell towers, data centers, and millions of homes and businesses. They form a massive,
            distributed layer of energy resilience that activates during grid failures. Yet
            <strong>no unified, public database records where these generators are, who operates them,
            or whether they actually function when needed</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This gap has real consequences. Emergency managers cannot assess which neighborhoods will
            retain power during a hurricane. Environmental regulators cannot track diesel generator
            emissions during prolonged outages. Energy equity researchers cannot measure whether
            low-income communities have less backup power access. The information simply does not exist
            at scale.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sec-1-2">1.2 Can Satellites Help?</h2>
          <p>
            We propose an unconventional approach: <strong>using nighttime satellite imagery to detect
            backup generators indirectly</strong>. NASA's Black Marble product (VIIRS VNP46A2) captures
            the brightness of every 500-meter patch of Earth's surface each night. During a power
            outage, most of a city goes dark — but locations with backup generators keep their lights on.
            This brightness anomaly is visible from space.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core idea is simple: if we compare nighttime brightness before and after a disaster,
            areas that stay anomalously bright during a blackout likely have backup power. We formalize
            this as the <em>Resilience Advantage (RA)</em> — the difference in brightness retention
            between areas near known facilities and the surrounding grid-dependent zones.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an <strong>exploratory project</strong>. We are not claiming to have solved generator
            detection — we are testing how far satellite remote sensing can take us, what it can and
            cannot reveal, and where the fundamental limitations lie.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sec-1-3">1.3 Approach</h2>
          <p>
            We use critical infrastructure locations (hospitals, airports, fire stations) from
            OpenStreetMap as a <strong>weak supervision signal</strong> — these facilities are likely
            to have generators, so nearby pixels serve as positive training labels. The analysis
            proceeds in three stages:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Stage 1 — Interpretive modeling:</strong> Four statistical models (OLS, MixedLM, Logistic, Cox PH) test whether the resilience signal is real and statistically significant.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 2 — Predictive modeling:</strong> Random Forest + XGBoost models predict pixel-level backup power probability, validated with Leave-One-Event-Out cross-validation across 25 events.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 3 — Zip-code analysis:</strong> Extending from pixels to policy-relevant geographic units, testing whether facility density correlates with historical outage severity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The full-feature ablation baseline (Model A, RF + XGBoost ensemble) achieves
            <strong>LOEO AUC 0.967</strong> — but most of that comes from spatial-proximity features
            that overlap with the facility-based label. The headline model (Model D) removes all
            facility-location features and achieves <strong>AUC 0.704</strong>, revealing
            that most predictive power comes from knowing <em>where facilities are</em>, not from
            the satellite signal alone. The pure NTL behavioral signal is real but modest — sufficient
            for exploratory screening at 500m resolution, not yet reliable enough for individual
            building-level detection.

            <p class="takeaway__text">
              This project turns a data gap — no generator records — into a detection problem:
              <strong>can we see generators from space?</strong> The answer is a qualified yes.
              Pure nighttime light behavior achieves <strong>AUC 0.704</strong> (above random but
              modest); adding facility-proximity features raises this to <strong>0.967</strong>. The gap between
              these numbers tells us exactly how much the satellite signal contributes versus
              what we already know from facility locations.

          <h2 id="sec-lr-1">2.1 Nighttime Light Remote Sensing for Disaster Monitoring</h2>
          <p>
            The use of satellite nighttime light (NTL) data for disaster impact assessment has
            grown substantially since the launch of the VIIRS Day/Night Band sensor in 2012.
            Unlike its predecessor DMSP/OLS, VIIRS provides calibrated, daily global NTL
            measurements at 500m resolution — enabling the first systematic temporal analyses
            of power outage patterns from space.

            Marble product (VNP46) can systematically monitor power outages across all stages of
            the disaster management cycle. Using Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Hurricane Maria (2017)
            as case studies, they introduced the <em>percent normal</em> metric:

          </div>

            Key contributions relevant to our work:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li>Black Marble can detect daily NTL changes of 0.43 nW/cm²/sr — 7× better than the
              JPSS requirement</li>
            <li>Lunar BRDF correction is critical to avoid false recovery signals from moonlight
              contamination</li>
            <li>The paper explicitly mentions using Black Marble to <strong>"position diesel

          <h3>Zhang et al. (2023) — Damage Assessment with Black Marble</h3>
          <p>
            Zhang et al. extended NTL-based damage assessment to multiple disaster types
            (hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes) and introduced a key methodological improvement:
            using <strong>monthly VNP46A3 data as the pre-disaster baseline</strong> instead of
            daily composites.

            Findings directly relevant to our project:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Daily NTL fluctuations average ~9.4%</strong> (range 3.6–15.2%) — this
              defines the noise floor for generator detection. A generator must change a pixel's
              brightness by more than ~10% to be detectable above normal variation.</li>
            <li>NTL performs well for <strong>hurricane damage in well-lit areas</strong> but is
              <strong>inconsistent for earthquakes and tornadoes</strong> — validating our
              observation that Maria (island-wide blackout) is a near-ideal case while other
              events present harder detection challenges.</li>
            <li>The method detects <strong>damaged vs. undamaged areas</strong> reliably but
              shows <strong>low correlation with degree of damage</strong> — consistent with
              our finding that the signal is binary (lights on/off) rather than proportional.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="sec-lr-2">2.2 Gap in the Literature</h2>
          <p>
            Both Wang et al. and Zhang et al. use NTL data to assess <em>outage extent and
            recovery</em> — they ask "where did the lights go out and when did they come back?"
            Our project asks a different question: <strong>"where did the lights stay on?"</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The distinction matters. Existing work treats NTL decline as the signal of interest
            (damage detection). We treat NTL <em>persistence</em> as the signal — areas that
            remain anomalously bright during a blackout likely have backup power. This inversion
            of the standard approach is, to our knowledge, the first systematic attempt to use
            NTL data for distributed backup power detection rather than outage mapping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, no prior work has:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li>Used critical facility locations as <strong>weak supervision labels</strong> for
              predicting backup power from NTL behavior</li>
            <li>Conducted <strong>ablation experiments</strong> (Models A–D) to quantify the
              relative contribution of NTL behavioral signal vs. spatial proximity</li>
            <li>Validated NTL-derived predictions against <strong>real generator permit
              records</strong> (Miami-Dade)</li>
            <li>Tested cross-event generalization with <strong>Leave-One-Event-Out</strong>
              validation across 25 diverse disaster events</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="sec-lr-3">2.3 Resilience and Equity in Power Systems</h2>
          <p>
            A growing body of literature examines energy equity and infrastructure resilience
            from a social science perspective. Studies have documented that low-income communities
            and communities of color can experience longer power outages during disasters. Our
            Stage 3 ZIP-level analysis is an exploratory connection to that literature: it measures
            sample associations using predicted probabilities, a current OSM facility snapshot,
            static 2022 ACS controls, and county-level outage data. It does not identify a causal
            facility effect or establish an infrastructure-equity gap.

          <h2 id="sec-2-1">3.1 NASA Black Marble — Nighttime Lights from Space</h2>
          <p>
            Our primary data source is <strong>NASA's Black Marble</strong> product suite (VNP46A2),
            which provides daily, gap-filled nighttime light (NTL) imagery at 500-meter resolution.
            The data comes from the VIIRS Day/Night Band sensor aboard the Suomi NPP satellite,
            which orbits Earth ~14 times per day and captures visible-band light emission after sunset.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>daily temporal resolution is critical</strong> for this project. Power outages
            unfold over days to weeks — generators activate within hours of a blackout and may run for
            days before grid power returns. A monthly or annual composite would blur this timeline
            into invisibility. Daily imagery lets us track the exact onset, duration, and spatial
            pattern of brightness anomalies as they evolve, day by day, through the disaster and
            recovery cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the <strong>500-meter spatial resolution is a significant limitation</strong>.
            A single pixel covers roughly 25 hectares — an area that may contain a hospital,
            surrounding parking lots, residential blocks, and a park. The generator signal from one
            building is mixed with ambient light (or darkness) from everything else in that pixel.
            This means we are detecting aggregate brightness patterns in the neighborhood of a
            facility, not the facility itself. Small generators (residential, single-business) are
            effectively invisible at this resolution; only large institutional generators that
            meaningfully change a 500m pixel's total radiance are detectable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The VNP46A2 product is not raw sensor output — it undergoes extensive processing by

          <p>
            The U.S. Department of Energy's EAGLE-I system provides county-level hourly power
            outage counts, which we use for event selection and temporal alignment. EAGLE-I
            aggregates outage reports from utilities across the country, giving us a county-level
            reference for when and where reported blackouts occurred. Access is partner-restricted,
            so the records are used only in authorized local analysis and are not redistributed.
            This data source is what
            tells us which disasters caused significant, sustained power outages worth studying
            with satellite imagery.
          </p>
          <p>We screened all severe weather events in EAGLE-I (2014–2023) and ranked them by a
            severity score (peak affected customers × max outage duration). Final selection criteria:</p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Outage duration</strong> > 72 hours — sustained enough for daily NTL to capture the outage-recovery arc</li>
            <li><strong>Peak affected</strong> > 100,000 customers — large enough to produce a spatially detectable NTL signal</li>
            <li><strong>County coverage</strong> ≥ 5 counties reporting — ensures the event is not a localized utility failure</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic diversity</strong> — events spanning different U.S. regions (Southeast, Northeast, Midwest, Southern Plains, Pacific Northwest) and disaster types (hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, derechos, ice storms)</li>
            <li><strong>Hurricane track verification</strong> — the reproducible rerun uses NHC HURDAT2 track and R34 fields; IBTrACS v4 remains documented as the original reference</li>

          <h2 id="sec-2-3">3.3 What Does a Disaster Look Like in NTL?</h2>
          <p>
            Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017 as a Category 5 storm,
            causing the longest blackout in U.S. history. <strong>Maria is the closest to an ideal
            case study for our method</strong>: the entire island went dark (near-total outage),
            recovery took months (long observation window), and Puerto Rico's tropical latitude
            means relatively low cloud cover compared to mid-latitude events. The NTL signal is
            dramatic and unambiguous — a best-case scenario for satellite detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other 14 events present progressively harder challenges: shorter outages (days
            instead of months), partial rather than total blackouts, higher cloud cover in winter
            storms, and urban areas where baseline brightness is so high that generator light
            is a small fraction of the pixel. How well the method transfers from Maria's ideal
            conditions to these harder cases is a key question this project aims to answer.
          </p>

            The player below shows daily satellite imagery of the San Juan metropolitan area.
            On the <strong>left</strong>, each frame is a raw NTL image — brighter pixels mean more light.
            On the <strong>right</strong>, each frame shows the <em>change from baseline</em> (delta NTL),
            computed as (day − BAU) / BAU, where BAU is the pre-disaster median composite.
            <strong style="color:var(--red,#ff6b6b)">Red pixels = dimmer than normal</strong> (outage),

          <p>
            Press play and watch: before September 20, the city pulses with normal nighttime activity.
            After the hurricane, the lights vanish almost entirely. Over the following two months,
            brightness returns unevenly — some areas recover quickly (often near hospitals and airports
            with backup power), while others remain dark for weeks.

          <h2 id="sec-2-4">3.4 Cloud Contamination & Quality Control</h2>
          <p>
            A fundamental challenge of optical satellite remote sensing is cloud cover. When clouds
            obscure the ground, the sensor cannot measure surface-emitted light, and the resulting
            pixel values are unreliable. This is especially problematic for disaster studies because
            the very weather systems that cause hurricanes also produce extensive cloud cover in the
            days surrounding landfall — precisely when we most need clear observations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The VNP46A2 product partially addresses this through its gap-filling algorithm, which
            uses temporal interpolation to estimate NTL values for clouded pixels. However, gap-filling
            has limits: when an entire region is cloud-covered for multiple consecutive days, the
            interpolated values become unreliable. We therefore apply a second quality control step
            after download.
          </p>
          <div class="callout callout--cyan">
            <span>--</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Two data strategies:</strong> In the exploratory phase (EDA), we applied
              strict QA-pixel-band masking during GEE export — only retaining genuinely cloud-free
              pixels and excluding cloudy days entirely (threshold: 30% cloud cover). This ensures
              the EDA statistics reflect real observations, not interpolations.
              <br /><br />
              For the predictive modeling phase, we expanded to 25 events using <strong>gap-filled
              imagery</strong> (VNP46A2) to maximize geographic coverage. Gap-filling uses temporal
              interpolation from neighboring days, which may slightly inflate post-disaster brightness
              for days with cloud cover (the algorithm borrows from pre-disaster values). However,
              since our models use <strong>pre/post period averages</strong> rather than single-day
              values, a few interpolated days within a 30–45 day window have minimal impact on the
              aggregate statistics.

          <p>
            All NTL imagery is downloaded programmatically through the Google Earth Engine (GEE)
            Python API. For each event, we define a bounding box covering the study area, a
            pre-disaster time window (typically 30 days before the event), and a post-disaster
            window (30–90 days after). GEE handles the server-side filtering and clipping, then
            exports each daily image as a GeoTIFF to Google Drive for local processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is reproducible and scalable — adding a new event requires only
            specifying the bounding box, disaster date, and time windows. The code below shows
            the core download logic for Hurricane Maria:

          <p>
            While no unified generator database exists, many U.S. jurisdictions do require permits
            for generator installation — but these records are fragmented, inconsistent, and hard
            to access. The permit type varies by jurisdiction and generator size:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Air quality permits</strong> — Large diesel generators (typically >50 kW)
              require emissions permits from state environmental agencies (e.g., EPA Title V,
              state-level "minor source" permits). These track fuel type and rated capacity but
              rarely include exact coordinates.</li>
            <li><strong>Building/electrical permits</strong> — Smaller generators require local
              building permits for installation. Miami-Dade County, for example, issues electrical
              permits tagged with "GENERATOR" in the work description. These include precise
              addresses but miss generators installed during original construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire department permits</strong> — Some jurisdictions require fire safety
              permits for fuel storage associated with generators, tracked separately from
              building permits.</li>
            <li><strong>Utility interconnection agreements</strong> — Generators capable of
              back-feeding the grid require utility approval, but these records are proprietary.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Two fundamental challenges prevent assembling a comprehensive generator database:</p>

            Our collaborators at <strong>Arizona State University</strong> and <strong>Temple
            University</strong> have been manually collecting generator permit data from county
            open data portals across our study areas. To date, <strong>Miami-Dade County</strong>
            (Florida) is the only jurisdiction with sufficiently complete, geocoded permit data
            for quantitative validation — yielding 592 generator permits (499 residential,
            93 commercial). This dataset is used in Section 6.7 to validate the predictive model's
            output against real generator locations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collection efforts for additional counties (Harris County TX, Duval County FL,
            Fulton County GA) are ongoing. The difficulty of assembling this data is itself
            a key motivation for our satellite-based detection approach — if generator locations
            were easy to compile, there would be less need for remote sensing.

          <h2 id="sec-2-7">3.7 Critical Infrastructure from OpenStreetMap</h2>
          <p>
            A core challenge of this project is that <strong>no public dataset of backup generator
            locations exists</strong>. We cannot simply look up which buildings have generators — this
            information is proprietary, scattered across utility companies, and rarely georeferenced.
            This is precisely why we turn to satellite imagery in the first place: to <em>infer</em>
            generator presence from the NTL signal rather than relying on direct records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our proxy approach: we identify <strong>critical infrastructure facilities</strong> —
            hospitals, airports, power plants, fire stations, and police stations — which are
            <em>legally required or highly likely</em> to have backup generators. By analyzing the
            NTL patterns in buffer zones around these facilities, we can detect whether backup
            power is actually activating during outages. The facility locations serve as our
            best available spatial prior for where generators should be.
          </p>
          <p>
            We source facility locations from OpenStreetMap (OSM) via its Overpass API — a free,
            crowd-sourced global geodatabase with generally excellent coverage of critical
            infrastructure in the U.S. and Turkey. For each event, we query all relevant facility
            types within the event's bounding box, extract coordinates and names, and cache the
            results locally. This produces between 50 and 420 facilities per event — from 52 in
            Hatay, Turkey to 420 in Miami, Florida.

            Airports receive a larger buffer radius (1,250m vs 750m) because their physical
            footprint spans multiple 500m pixels — runways, terminals, and support buildings
            spread across a much larger area than a single hospital or fire station. The buffer
            must encompass the facility's entire lighting footprint, not just its centroid.

          <p>
            Our 15 events span very different contexts — geographies from Caribbean islands to
            the U.S. Midwest, city sizes from Lake Charles (~80K) to Atlanta (~6M metro),
            disaster types (hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms, derechos), and recovery
            timelines from 2 weeks (Irma) to 11 months (Maria). This heterogeneity is both
            a strength for testing generalizability and a challenge: the "generator signature"
            may manifest differently across these conditions. The LOEO cross-validation in
            Section 6 directly tests whether a universal detection model can work despite
            these differences.

              We have no direct data on backup generators — no database tells us which buildings

              light as an indirect signal, and critical facility locations as a spatial prior for
              where generators <em>should</em> be. Combined with 500m resolution, cloud contamination,
              and cross-event diversity, this means individual pixel-level predictions should be
              interpreted with caution. The strength of this approach lies in
              <strong>aggregate statistical patterns</strong> — the consistent tendency for buffer
              zones around critical infrastructure to maintain higher NTL ratios during outages

          <h2 id="sec-4-1">3.1 Key Definitions</h2>
          <p>
            Before analyzing the data, we need to define the metrics that quantify how well
            an area maintains nighttime brightness during a power outage. These definitions
            are central to everything that follows.
          </p>

          <h3>Business-As-Usual (BAU) Baseline</h3>
          <p>
            For each pixel, the <strong>BAU</strong> (Business-As-Usual) is the median NTL
            brightness across all pre-disaster observation days. This represents "normal"
            nighttime brightness — what the pixel would look like if no disaster had occurred.
            We use the median rather than the mean to reduce sensitivity to individual cloudy
            or anomalous days.
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">BAU = median(NTL<sub>pre,day1</sub>, NTL<sub>pre,day2</sub>, ..., NTL<sub>pre,dayN</sub>)</div>

          <h3>Resilience Ratio (R)</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Resilience Ratio</strong> measures how much of a pixel's normal brightness
            is maintained on a given post-disaster day. It is defined as:
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">R = NTL<sub>post,day</sub> / BAU</div>
            <div class="formula__caption">R = 1.0 means full brightness maintained; R = 0 means complete darkness</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            An R value of <strong>1.0</strong> means the pixel is as bright as its pre-disaster
            baseline — either the power grid never failed, or backup generators are sustaining
            the lights. An R of <strong>0.3</strong> means only 30% of normal brightness remains.
            Values above 1.0 are possible (e.g., emergency lighting, reconstruction activity)
            but uncommon.
          </p>

          <h3>Delta NTL</h3>
          <p>
            For the pixel panel, we also compute a summary metric across the entire post-disaster
            window:
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">delta_ntl = (post_mean − pre_mean) / pre_mean</div>
            <div class="formula__caption">Negative values indicate NTL loss; -0.5 means a 50% drop in brightness</div>
          </div>

          <h3>Damage Label</h3>
          <p>
            For classification, pixels are labeled as <strong>"damaged"</strong> if their
            <code>delta_ntl &lt; -0.10</code> (more than 10% brightness loss). This threshold
            was chosen to exclude minor fluctuations while capturing meaningful outage impacts.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sec-4-2">3.2 Buffer Zone vs. Non-Buffer Comparison</h2>
          <p>
            The core analysis compares NTL recovery patterns between two groups of pixels:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Buffer pixels</strong> — within 750m (hospitals, fire stations, power plants)
              or 1250m (airports) of a critical facility</li>
            <li><strong>Non-buffer pixels</strong> — all other urban pixels in the study area,
              not near any known critical infrastructure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If backup generators are producing a detectable NTL signal, we expect buffer pixels
            to have <strong>higher R values</strong> than non-buffer pixels during the post-disaster
            period. This difference is the <em>Resilience Advantage (RA)</em>:
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">RA = R&#772;<sub>buffer</sub> − R&#772;<sub>non-buffer</sub></div>
            <div class="formula__caption">Positive RA = buffer zones recover faster or maintain brightness better</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The <RouterLink to="/charts" class="inline-link">Recovery Charts</RouterLink> page
            visualizes these daily R curves for all 9 events. In most events, the buffer curve
            (green) consistently sits above the non-buffer curve (blue) during the post-disaster
            window — but the magnitude varies considerably.
          </p>

          <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
          <h2 id="sec-4-3">3.3 The Floor Effect</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>floor effect</strong> is the most important confound in this analysis,
            and understanding it is essential to interpreting results correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In large cities like Miami and San Juan, critical infrastructure (hospitals, airports)
            tends to be located in brighter commercial/urban districts. Buffer pixels start with
            high BAU values, and even a large percentage drop still leaves them brighter than
            surrounding residential areas. The buffer advantage is easy to detect.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in <strong>smaller cities</strong> like Lake Charles and Panama City, the situation
            reverses: hospitals and fire stations are often in the <em>darker</em> parts of
            the urban core. Their BAU values are low to begin with. When the grid fails, these
            pixels can drop to near-zero NTL — creating a "floor" below which they cannot fall
            further. This means <strong>buffer pixels in small cities may actually show LOWER
            R values than non-buffer pixels</strong>, not because they lack generators, but because
            their baseline was already dim.
          </p>
          <div class="callout callout--amber">
            <span>⚠️</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Why this matters:</strong> A naive comparison of R<sub>buffer</sub> vs
              R<sub>non-buffer</sub> in small cities would conclude that critical infrastructure
              has <em>worse</em> resilience — the opposite of reality. The floor effect creates
              a systematic bias that must be controlled for in any statistical or predictive model.

          <h3>Floor Effect — Empirical Evidence</h3>
          <p>
            The table and chart below show this effect clearly with real data from our pixel panel.
            In <strong>large cities</strong>, buffer pixels start brighter (6.69 vs 4.18 nW/cm²/sr)
            and show slightly less NTL loss. But in <strong>small cities</strong>, buffer pixels
            actually show <em>more</em> loss than non-buffer — the floor effect in action.

            The EDA confirms this hierarchy: model-predicted probabilities show clear stratification
            by facility group, with Group 1 buffer pixels consistently scoring highest.
            Interestingly, the <em>individual</em> facility type indicators for Group 1
            (near_hospital, near_aerodrome, near_power_plant) show zero feature importance in
            the predictive model — because they are perfectly correlated with the buffer label
            itself. The meaningful variation comes from <strong>Group 2 vs. Group 1</strong>
            and the <strong>fac_group ordinal</strong> feature.

            Additionally, disaster type introduces variation: <strong>hurricanes</strong> produce
            widespread, sustained outages with gradual recovery, while <strong>earthquakes</strong>
            cause more sudden, spatially concentrated damage. The two earthquake events
            (San Juan 2020, Hatay 2023) are geographically coupled only to their specific
            regions, making cross-event earthquake generalization particularly challenging.

              <strong>1. The resilience signal is real but subtle.</strong> Buffer zones show
              consistently higher R values in most events, but the magnitude (RA ≈ 5–20%) is
              small relative to pixel-level noise.<br /><br />
              <strong>2. Floor effect is the dominant confound.</strong> In small cities, raw
              buffer-vs-non-buffer comparisons can be misleading or reversed. Any valid analysis
              must control for baseline brightness.<br /><br />
              <strong>3. Facility type matters.</strong> Hospitals and airports (Group 1) show the
              strongest resilience signal. Fire stations and police (Group 2) contribute a weaker
              but detectable signal. Government buildings and substations (Group 3) show no
              meaningful generator signature.<br /><br />
              <strong>4. City size systematically affects model performance.</strong> Large-city
              events are easiest to predict; small-city events with strong floor effects are hardest.
              This has direct implications for cross-event generalization.

          <!-- ═══ 5.0 Why Interpretive Modeling ═══ -->
          <h2 id="sec-5-1">5.1 Why Interpretive Modeling First?</h2>
          <p>
            Before building a predictive model, we need to answer a more fundamental question:
            <strong>is there actually a detectable signal?</strong> The EDA shows that buffer
            zones near facilities have higher resilience ratios on average — but is that
            difference statistically significant, or could it be explained by confounding
            variables like urban brightness and land use?
          </p>
          <p>
            Interpretive modeling serves three purposes in our pipeline:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Validate the signal exists</strong> — If four different statistical
              models all find a significant effect in the same direction, the signal is unlikely
              to be an artifact of any single model's assumptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand what drives it</strong> — OLS interaction terms reveal that
              the effect depends on baseline brightness (floor effect). MixedLM shows the
              effect survives event-level clustering. Logistic regression gives intuitive
              odds ratios. Cox PH adds the time dimension.</li>
            <li><strong>Guide feature engineering</strong> — The confounds and interactions
              discovered here directly inform which features we engineer for the predictive
              models in Stage 2. The floor effect motivates city-level normalization; the
              land-use confound motivates NLCD controls; the facility-type variation
              motivates group-level features.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is the <strong>triangulation</strong> approach: four models, same hypothesis,
            different angles. Only when all four point in the same direction can we confidently
            proceed to prediction.

            is the key discovery — with NLCD controls, it becomes highly significant (p = 0.0002),
            revealing that the <strong>generator effect is stronger in brighter areas</strong> and
            invisible in dim small cities. This is the statistical fingerprint of the floor effect.

                The generator advantage manifests as <em>recovery speed</em>, not <em>final outcome</em>.

          <p>
            The most important methodological finding: when NLCD land-use controls are added,
            the buffer coefficient <strong>reverses sign or loses significance</strong> in all models.
            Critical facilities tend to be in more developed areas (NLCD 22–24), and developed
            areas recover faster regardless of generators.

            However, the <strong>interaction term</strong> remains highly significant with NLCD:
            the generator effect is real but <em>conditional on baseline brightness</em>. In bright
            urban areas, generators produce a visible NTL bump. In dim small-city areas, the
            signal is buried in the floor effect. This is not "the effect doesn't exist" — it's
            "the effect is heterogeneous."

            all events. Now we flip the direction: instead of testing whether buffer zones are

          <p>
            Model A is the <strong>upper-bound ablation baseline</strong>: it uses all
            <strong>17 engineered features</strong> spanning four categories — NTL behavior
            (6 features), spatial proximity (4), city/disaster controls (3), and interaction
            terms (4). It is <em>not</em> our headline deliverable: because its features
            include facility-proximity variables (<code>log_dist</code>, <code>near_*</code>,
            <code>fac_group</code>) that are derived from the same facility locations used to
            build the label, its high AUC partially reflects label leakage. We report it to
            quantify how much spatial context alone contributes (vs. Model D below). Three
            algorithms are compared:

            The final ensemble combines RF and XGBoost: <code>P = 0.7 × P_RF + 0.3 × P_XGB</code>.

          <h3>Why AUC, Not Precision/Recall?</h3>
          <p>
            Classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1 require choosing a probability
            threshold (e.g., P > 0.5 = "has generator"). But our goal is not binary classification
            — it's <strong>spatial ranking</strong>: which areas are more likely to have backup power?
            The threshold choice is arbitrary and application-dependent.

          <p>
            An AUC of 0.967 means: if you randomly pick one pixel from a generator-buffer area and
            one from outside, the ablation-baseline (Model A) assigns higher probability to the
            buffer pixel <strong>96.7% of the time</strong>. Note: this number is inflated by the
            fact that Model A's features include facility-proximity variables derived from the
            same labels — see Model D (§7.5) for the leakage-controlled version.
          </p>

          <h3>7.3 Model B — Post-Disaster Only</h3>
          <p>
            Model B removes all pre-disaster NTL features (<code>log_pre_ntl</code>,
            <code>ntl_relative</code>, <code>log_city_pre_mean</code>, <code>below_city_median</code>).
            This tests whether the generator detection signal comes from <strong>post-disaster
            behavior</strong> (lights staying on during outage) or <strong>pre-disaster urban
            structure</strong> (brighter areas = more infrastructure).
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">Model B AUC = 0.969 vs Model A AUC = 0.967 → Delta = +0.002</div>
            <div class="formula__caption">Pre-disaster brightness contributes negligibly</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The near-identical AUC confirms that <strong>pre-disaster NTL is not necessary</strong>
            for prediction. The model relies primarily on spatial proximity features and post-disaster
            NTL changes. This is methodologically important: it means the model is not simply learning
            "bright areas have generators" but detecting genuine behavioral signals.
          </p>

          <h3>7.4 Model C — With Building Footprints</h3>
          <p>
            Model C augments Model A with four features derived from <strong>OSM building footprint
            coverage</strong> within each pixel: total coverage ratio, log-transformed coverage,
            coverage × pre-NTL interaction, and a binary indicator for meaningful building presence
            (>1% coverage).
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">Model C AUC = 0.966 vs Model A AUC = 0.967 → Delta = -0.001</div>
            <div class="formula__caption">Building footprints do not improve prediction</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The null result makes sense: building footprints correlate strongly with existing features
            (<code>log_pre_ntl</code>, <code>log_dist</code>) and add no independent signal. At 500m
            resolution, individual building outlines are too fine-grained to help pixel-level prediction.
          </p>

          <h3>7.5 Model D — Pure NTL Behavior (Headline Model)</h3>
          <p>
            Model D is the <strong>headline deliverable</strong> of Stage 2 and the model whose
            probabilities feed every downstream product (interactive dashboard, Stage 3 ZIP
            regression, Miami-Dade ground-truth check). It removes <strong>all spatial proximity
            features</strong> (<code>log_dist</code>, <code>near_fire_station</code>,
            <code>near_police</code>, <code>near_excluded</code>, <code>fac_group</code>) and
            all interaction terms. Only 10 features remain, all derived from NTL magnitude
            and temporal change.
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">Model D AUC = 0.704  vs  Model A AUC = 0.967  →  Spatial leakage = +0.263</div>
            <div class="formula__caption">The 0.263 gap quantifies how much of Model A's apparent performance was label leakage from facility-proximity features</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            This is the key finding: <strong>pure nighttime light behavior achieves AUC 0.704</strong>
            — significantly above random (0.5), confirming that NTL changes carry a genuine backup
            power detection signal. The fact that Model A jumps to 0.967 when facility-proximity
            features are added back tells us most of that gain is statistical leakage rather than
            additional generator detection. Model D's 0.704 is the honest upper bound for
            "what can a 500m satellite see, given no facility locations."

          <div class="callout callout--cyan">
            <span>--</span>
            <div>
              <strong>Interpretation:</strong> The 0.704 AUC from Model D represents the "pure remote
              sensing" capability — detecting generators solely from satellite observations without
              any ground-truth facility locations. This is the answer to the core research question:
              yes, nighttime light changes can detect commercial backup generators from space, and
              the Miami-Dade ground-truth check (§7.7) confirms this with 83% of permitted commercial
              installations scoring above the event-wide median probability.

          <h3>Hyperparameter rationale (Production Model)</h3>
          <p>
            The Production Model trains a Random Forest and an XGBoost classifier on the
            10 NTL features and combines them with a 0.7&nbsp;/&nbsp;0.3 ensemble weight.
            Several hyperparameters are intentionally non-default — chosen to handle two
            project-specific challenges: (1) the labels are <em>proxy</em> labels (a pixel
            inside a 750&nbsp;m hospital buffer is not guaranteed to actually have a generator),
            and (2) the positive class is imbalanced (~21 % of pixels are inside any HIGH/MEDIUM
            facility buffer).

            The general philosophy: <strong>shallow trees + large leaves</strong> for both
            algorithms, paired with explicit class-imbalance handling. The model is deliberately
            constrained so that it cannot memorise the proxy label's noise; what survives the
            constraint is treated as a real signal.

          <p>
            Standard k-fold cross-validation is invalid for spatially autocorrelated disaster data:
            pixels within the same event are highly correlated, and random splitting would leak
            spatial information. LOEO addresses this by holding out <strong>entire events</strong>:

          <p>
            To validate the models' predictions against real-world data, we used
            <strong>building permit records</strong> from Miami-Dade County that identify
            properties with generator installations. The records carry an explicit
            residential / commercial flag (<code>RESCOMM</code>): 499 R + 93 C across the
            full county, of which 169 fall within our Irma_Miami study bbox (139 R + 30 C),
            and <strong>136 of those have probability values in the panel (106 R + 30 C)</strong>.

              Major facilities (airport, hospital, port) likely had generators from the start
              and are absent from permit records. The true commercial generator count is
              therefore higher than 30, making the validation conservative.

            events</strong> (Puerto Rico and Turkey excluded due to lack of U.S. ZCTA boundaries).
            Events selected from EAGLE-I based on severity (duration > 72h, peak > 100K affected,
            >= 5 counties). Geographic coverage spans 15 U.S. states from Florida to Washington.

            The canonical descriptive model uses the Stage 2 ensemble probability, current OSM
            facility density, 2022 ACS controls, and event fixed effects. County-level outage
            severity is assigned only for exploratory sensitivity analyses using each ZCTA
            centroid's county. That assignment does not create ZIP-level ground truth.

            a model prediction, so this is an in-sample fit, not predictive accuracy and not a

            Across three stages of analysis — interpretive modeling, predictive modeling, and
            zip-code spatial regression — several conclusions emerge:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>The satellite signal is real but modest.</strong> Pure nighttime light
              behavior (Model D) achieves AUC 0.704 — above random, confirming that brightness
              anomalies during outages carry genuine information about backup power. But this
              signal alone is insufficient for reliable detection at 500m resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial context is the dominant predictor.</strong> Knowing where critical
              facilities are located adds +0.263 AUC, raising performance to 0.967. The model
              primarily learns that areas near hospitals and airports tend to stay brighter — a
              useful but less novel finding.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-event consistency is descriptive, not causal.</strong> Facility-buffer
              comparisons point in the same direction across the 25 Stage 2 events, while Stage 3
              covers 22 U.S. events. Shared geography, proxy labels, and event-specific measurement
              mean that consistency alone does not prove a protective facility effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial generators are detectable; residential are not.</strong>
              Miami-Dade permit ground-truth (592 standalone-generator records, 169 within the
              Irma_Miami study area) shows a clear divide: <strong>83% of commercial</strong>
              permit locations sit above Model D's event-wide median probability, while only
              <strong>14% of residential</strong> permits do. Detection capability is concentrated
              at commercial / institutional scale (hospitals, airports, mid-size facilities);
              household-scale backup power lies below the 500m VIIRS noise floor.</li>
            <li><strong>No unified generator database exists, and building one from permits is
              impractical.</strong> This data gap — confirmed through our permit collection effort
              — is itself the strongest motivation for satellite-based approaches.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="sec-c-2">Limitations: Sensor Constraints</h2>
          <p>
            The most fundamental limitation of this project is <strong>spatial resolution</strong>.
            The entire analysis rests on NASA's Black Marble VNP46A2, which provides 500m pixels.
            To understand why this matters — and what alternatives exist — we compare the two
            primary nighttime light satellite platforms:

          <h3>Why 500m is insufficient</h3>
          <p>
            At 500m, a single pixel covers ~25 hectares — an area that may contain a hospital,
            its parking lot, three apartment blocks, a park, and a gas station. A hospital's
            backup generator illuminating its campus produces perhaps 5–10% of the pixel's total
            radiance. This signal is comparable to the ~9.4% daily NTL fluctuation reported by
            Zhang et al. (2023), making individual generator detection statistically unreliable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stage 3 reinforces this measurement warning rather than resolving it. Facility density,
            population density, income, and urban structure are intertwined, while the outcome is a
            model prediction at 500m. The controlled fit therefore cannot isolate a generator effect.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Luojia-1 is not the answer (yet)</h3>
          <p>
            Luojia-1's 130m resolution (~1.7 hectares per pixel) is a ~15× improvement in area
            over VIIRS. At this scale, a hospital campus would occupy multiple pixels, potentially
            allowing the generator-lit area to be distinguished from the surrounding darkness.
            However, Luojia-1 has critical limitations for disaster applications:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>15-day revisit.</strong> Power outages evolve over hours to days. A 15-day
              gap means the satellite might miss the entire outage event, or only catch the
              recovery phase. VIIRS's daily coverage is essential for temporal tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>250 km swath.</strong> Hurricanes affect areas spanning 500–1,000 km.
              Luojia-1's narrow swath would require multiple passes (15+ days) to cover a single
              event — by which time recovery would be underway.</li>
            <li><strong>Experimental status.</strong> Luojia-1 was a technology demonstrator
              (2018–2022), not an operational mission. Data access is limited and not integrated
              into standard geospatial platforms like GEE.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Other limitations</h3>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Weak supervision label.</strong> OSM facility locations are a proxy for
              generator presence. Some facilities lack generators; some non-listed buildings
              (hotels, data centers) have them.</li>
            <li><strong>Gap-filled imagery.</strong> The 16 newer events use NASA's gap-filled
              product, where cloudy days are temporally interpolated — potentially attenuating
              the outage signal during storm periods.</li>
            <li><strong>EAGLE-I granularity.</strong> Outage data is county-level, requiring
              weighted disaggregation to zip codes that introduces uncertainty.</li>
            <li><strong>Overpass timing.</strong> VIIRS crosses at ~01:30 local time. Generators
              that run only during evening peak hours (18:00–23:00) may have shut down by the
              time the satellite passes overhead.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="sec-c-3">Future Directions: Sensor Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            Based on our findings, we can specify what a purpose-built nighttime light sensor
            for backup power detection would need:
          </p>

          <h3>Resolution requirement</h3>
          <p>
            To isolate individual facility generator signals from surrounding urban background,
            the pixel must be smaller than the facility footprint. A typical hospital campus is
            200–400m across; a fire station is 30–50m. To detect hospital-scale generators with
            at least 4 pixels on target:
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">Required resolution ≤ 100m (ideally 50m)</div>
            <div class="formula__caption">At 50m, a hospital occupies ~16 pixels; at 100m, ~4 pixels</div>
          </div>
          <p>
            At 100m, the pixel area is 1 hectare — a 25× improvement over VIIRS. This would
            allow the facility campus to be spatially resolved from adjacent land uses, making
            the generator signal detectable above the urban background.
          </p>

          <h3>Temporal requirement</h3>
          <p>
            Power outages from hurricanes typically last 3–14 days. To capture the onset,
            peak outage, and recovery arc:
          </p>
          <div class="formula-block">
            <div class="formula">Required revisit ≤ 1 day</div>
            <div class="formula__caption">Daily coverage essential for outage temporal dynamics</div>
          </div>

          <h3>Constellation architecture options</h3>
          <div class="data-table">
            <table>
              <thead><tr><th>Approach</th><th>Resolution</th><th>Revisit</th><th>Tradeoff</th></tr></thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>

                  <td>Balanced. A single satellite with 1,500km swath at 100m could provide

                  <td>Incremental improvement. Planned for JPSS-3/4, but resolution may remain
                    at 500m due to swath requirements.</td>
                </tr>

                  <td>Combine VIIRS daily coverage with occasional Luojia/Jilin-1 high-res snapshots.
                    Super-resolution ML could bridge the gap.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <h3>Orbit considerations</h3>
          <p>
            Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) is standard for NTL sensors because it provides
            consistent local overpass times. However, the overpass time matters:
          </p>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>~01:30 (VIIRS):</strong> Late night — minimal human activity, but
              generators may have shut down after evening peak.</li>
            <li><strong>~22:00–23:00 (Luojia-1):</strong> More likely to catch active generators
              during evening operations, but higher background light from traffic and
              commercial activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Ideal: dual-pass (21:00 + 03:00)</strong> — one pass catches peak
              generator activity, another catches the quiet background for baseline comparison.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Beyond sensors: data integration</h3>
          <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Smart meter fusion.</strong> Where utility smart meter data is available,
              supervised learning with actual outage timestamps could replace the weak-supervision
              buffer approach — providing building-level ground truth.</li>
            <li><strong>Emission estimation.</strong> Detected generator locations + fuel type
              databases + runtime estimates → backup generator emission modeling, relevant for
              environmental justice and air quality assessment during prolonged outages.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time alerting.</strong> As NTL products approach near-real-time
              delivery (NASA Black Marble NRT is in development), the method could support
              emergency response: identifying which facilities have activated backup power
              within hours of a blackout.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-country transfer.</strong> The method is sensor-agnostic and
              transferable. Applying it to non-U.S. disasters — where outage records are
              even scarcer — could provide first-of-its-kind resilience mapping.</li>
          </ul>

              <strong>Bottom line for sensor manufacturers:</strong> A nighttime light sensor
              at <strong>≤100m resolution</strong> with <strong>daily revisit</strong> and
              <strong>≥1,000 km swath</strong> would enable the transition from "detecting
              urban centers" to "detecting individual generators." This requires either a
              6-satellite constellation or a single wide-swath platform with advanced optics —
              technically feasible with current technology but not yet funded by any space agency.
